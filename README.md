## Installing for the first time
The first time you'd like to look at the website locally, you will need to install a webserver. From the root directory you have the repository installed into on your local machine run:

```
npm install
```

Now you can run scripts

## NPM Scripts
### Running the local webserver
To start the local webserver (so you can navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`) and see the project:
```
npm run start
```

### Deploying to surge

```
npm run deploy

or

npm run deploy:surge.sh
